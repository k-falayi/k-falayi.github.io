                                      At 43 percent, financial inclusion is still low in sub-Saharan Africa despite the recent increase 
                                      due to mobile money services. This is a BBC TV story in which I explore how Africa's emerging investment clubs work
                                      and what impact it is having on the ability of young people to create wealth.
