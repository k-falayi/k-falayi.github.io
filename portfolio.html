                                   <p>I have always loved animated visualizations. I did this for the web version of a newspaper feature story I wrote about Nigeria's 
                                        rice consumption. My aim was to compare Nigeria to another rice producing country - 
                                        Brazil - in terms of rice production and consumption capacity to. I don't know, you think this makes sense?
